# MoviePicker
Flask app which selects a top rated film from rotten tomatoes that has scored >80% for both Audience and Critics. Hit the next button to load up another. 

I developed this project earlier this year to get a better understanding of scraping websites and also use the basics of Flask to present the information. Results are saved into a Excel Spreadsheet which in turn the Flask app reads the information form and randomly selects a title. 

The app uses the direct poster links, scores and information from RT.

Example as shown below:
